Feature: show room capacity and facilities

    As a Berkeley Student
    So that I can decide which room fits my needs
    I want to see details of any selected room
 
Background: rooms have been added to database

  Given the following buildings exist:
  | name                   | misc |
  | Haas Faculty Wing      |      |

  And the following rooms exist:
  | number     | capacity   | building_id  | facilities                           | misc                    |
  | F295       | 299        | 1            | ADA-Instructor Accessible            | Lecture Hall            |
