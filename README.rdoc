=== Room Reservation

Room Reservation is a project whose main goal is to provide students and staff members of UC Berkeley a convenient way to obtain information on rooms across campus to be reserved. It is a very user-friendly website, displaying an interactive map of campus which highlights all the buildings that are part of this project. We currently support login authentication through Calnet.

Our website displays the following features and search filters:
* Capacity
* Location
* Technologies (Projector, AV Devices, Computer, et al)
* Room Type
* Misc. (ADA Accessible, et al)

Future goals are efficient communication across these buildings in order to make booking and reservations available directly through the website. Currently, there are administrative hindrances that limit the scope of this project.
